## ChronoLog Project Overview
ChronoLog is a scalable, high-performance distributed shared log store designed to handle the ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of modern activity data. It is tailored for applications ranging from edge computing to high-performance computing (HPC) systems, offering a versatile solution for managing log data across diverse domains.

## Core Features
- **Multi-Tiered Storage:** Leverages multiple storage tiers (e.g., persistent memory, flash storage) to scale log capacity and optimize performance.
- **High Concurrency:** Supports multiple writers and multiple readers (MWMR) for efficient concurrent access to the log.
- **Partial Data Retrieval:** Enables efficient range queries for partial log processing, enhancing data exploration capabilities.
- **Total Ordering:** Guarantees strict ordering of log entries across distributed environments, eliminating the need for costly synchronization.
- **Synchronization-Free:** Employs physical time for log ordering, avoiding expensive synchronization operations.
- **Auto-Tiering:** Automatically and transparently moves log data across storage tiers based on age and access patterns.
- **Elastic I/O:** Adapts to varying I/O workloads, ensuring efficient resource utilization and performance.

## Applicability
ChronoLog is designed to address the challenges of modern applications that generate and process vast amounts of log data. It is particularly well-suited for:
- **Scientific Applications:** Astrophysics, geoscience, materials science, cosmology, and more.
- **Internet-of-Things (IoT):** Efficiently stores, indexes, queries, and analyzes data from IoT devices.
- **Financial Applications:** Supports real-time monitoring, time-series analysis, and fraud protection.
- **HPC Resource Management:** Optimizes resource utilization in large-scale HPC systems.
- **System Telemetry and Trace Recording:** Captures and analyzes telemetry data from distributed systems.
- **Application Performance Analysis:** Facilitates performance monitoring and analysis for complex applications.

## Key Innovations
- **Physical Time-Based Ordering:** A novel approach to achieving total ordering in distributed systems without synchronization overhead.
- **3D Log Distribution:** A unique model that distributes log data horizontally across nodes and vertically across storage tiers.
- **Decoupled Server-Pull Architecture:** Separates event ingestion from event persistence for enhanced performance and scalability.

## Development Team
ChronoLog is being developed by a team of researchers and engineers at Illinois Tech and the University of Chicago.
